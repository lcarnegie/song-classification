# Song Cluster

## Overview

This repository contains the analysis and clustering of songs based on their audio features. The project aims to identify patterns and group similar songs together to help understand musical preferences and potentially build recommendation systems.

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

* **data/raw_data** contains the raw song data (compressed) as obtained from the FMA as well as the raw audio files generated by the Meta MuseGen model through MusicGPT.
* **data/analysis_data** contains the cleaned and processed dataset that was constructed for analysis.
* **models.zip** contains fitted clustering models, make sure to uncompress them before use.
* **other** contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
* **paper** contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the final PDF of the paper.
* **scripts** contains the scripts used to download, clean, and analyze the song data.

## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code were written with the help of GitHub Copilot.
