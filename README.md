# Song Cluster

## Overview

This repository contains the files and workflow used to write my paper 'Do Machines Think Equally About Music?". It exists so that you are able to exactly reproduce the steps I took to get the results I did in the paper. 

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

* **data/raw_data** contains the raw song data (compressed) as obtained from the FMA as well as the raw audio files generated by the Meta MuseGen model through MusicGPT.
* **data/analysis_data** contains the cleaned and processed dataset that was constructed for analysis.
* **models** contains fitted clustering models and their evaluation metrics.
* **other** contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
* **paper** contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper.
* **scripts** contains the scripts used to download, clean, and analyze the song data.

## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code were written with the help of GitHub Copilot.
