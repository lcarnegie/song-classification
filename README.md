# Song Cluster

## Overview

**Song Cluster** is the companion repository to my undergraduate research paper, _Do Machines Think Equally About Music?_.  
This project investigates how well a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained on human-made music can classify songs generated by a machine learning model, Meta’s MuseGen (via the MusicGPT interface).

The repository is organized to allow complete and exact reproduction of the study, including:

- Downloading and cleaning raw music data,
- Training several machine learning classifiers (SVM, KNN, Random Forest, XGBoost) on audio feature datasets,
- Prompting a small MuseGen model to generate genre-specific music clips,
- Extracting features from machine-generated music,
- Testing the ability of a classifier to predict the genre of AI-generated songs,
- Producing the final paper.

The study highlights the limitations of current machine learning approaches to both music generation and classification, suggesting directions for future research in music information retrieval and generative AI.

## Reproduction Steps

Follow these steps to fully reproduce the paper’s results:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lcarnegie/song-classification.git
   cd song-classification
   ```

2. **Prepare the Data**  
   - Unzip the `models.zip` file to access pretrained models.
   - The `data/raw_data/` folder contains compressed audio and extracted feature files.

3. **Run Data Processing Scripts**  
   In `scripts/`, run:
   ```bash
   python clean_fma_data.py
   python generate_music_prompts.py
   python extract_features.py
   ```

4. **Train Classifiers** (Optional)  
   If you want to retrain models rather than using the provided ones:
   ```bash
   python train_models.py
   ```

5. **Classify Generated Music**  
   After generating feature sets for the machine-generated songs:
   ```bash
   python classify_generated_music.py
   ```

6. **Build the Paper (Optional)**  
   If you'd like to regenerate the paper PDF:
   ```bash
   quarto render paper/paper.qmd
   ```

## Main Findings

- The SVM model trained on human music failed to correctly classify any machine-generated song into the correct genre.
- Results suggest a gap between machine-generated and human-composed music in terms of recognizable genre-specific patterns.
- Larger models or more sophisticated prompts may improve future genre fidelity in music generation.

Would you also like me to help you quickly create a polished `requirements.txt` and a `.gitignore` you can drop into your repo?  
It would make it even cleaner for when others clone and run it! 🚀
